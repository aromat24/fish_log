  - âœ… GameOverScene with score display and restart options

- **Essential Game Entities**
  - âœ… Player entity (fishing rod/character)
  - âœ… Fishing line physics and rendering
  - âœ… Fish entities with AI behaviors
  - âœ… Water/environment rendering with animated waves

- **Basic Game Loop**

  - âœ… Collision detection between line and fish
  - âœ… Scoring and progression systems

#### Phase 2: Motion Controls Integration  
- **Motion Input Processing**
  - âœ… Motion sensor data mapped to fishing actions (cast, reel, etc.)
  - âœ… Calibration system for different device orientations
  - âœ… Touch fallback controls for devices without motion sensors

- **Fishing Mechanics**
  - âœ… Rod casting physics using motion controls
  - âœ… Reeling mechanism with motion feedback
  - âœ… Fish fighting mechanics using device motion

#### Phase 3: Error Handling & Polish
- **Robust Error Handling**
  - âœ… Comprehensive try/catch blocks throughout
  - âœ… Graceful fallbacks when components are missing
  - âœ… Detailed console logging for debugging

## ðŸŽ® How to Test

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```
The app will be available at: `http://localhost:35059` (or similar port)

### 2. Test the Game
1. **Open the app** in your browser
2. **Click "Fish Now!" button** to launch the game
3. **Game Controls:**
   - **Space** = Cast fishing line
   - **R** = Reel in line
   - **ESC** = Exit game
   - **Touch** = Alternative casting (tap screen)

### 3. Test Motion Controls (Mobile/Tablet)
1. Open the app on a mobile device
2. Grant motion sensor permissions when prompted
3. Use **forward motion** to cast
4. Use **circular motions** to reel

### 4. Debug Testing
- Open **Developer Console** (F12) for detailed logs
- Use the test page: `http://localhost:35059/test-game.html`
- Red test button in top-right provides additional debugging

## ðŸŽ¯ Game Mechanics

### Fishing Process
1. **Cast**: Use motion controls or spacebar to cast line
2. **Wait**: Fish will approach the hook automatically  
3. **Bite**: Visual/particle effects indicate when fish bites
4. **Reel**: Use motion controls or 'R' key to reel in fish
5. **Catch**: Successfully land fish for points

### Scoring System
- **Common Fish**: 50 points
- **Rare Fish** (golden): 100 points
- **Time Limit**: 60 seconds per game session

### Visual Features
- Animated water with realistic waves
- Particle effects for splashes and celebrations
- Smooth fishing line physics
- Fish AI with random movement patterns

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Core Game Engine**: `fishingGameCore.js`
- **Scene Management**: Menu â†’ Fishing â†’ Game Over
- **Motion Controls**: Full sensor integration with fallbacks
- **Input System**: Unified touch, keyboard, and motion input
- **Rendering**: Canvas-based with 60fps optimization

### Error Handling
- All components have robust error handling
- Graceful degradation when features unavailable
- Detailed logging for debugging issues

### Performance
- Adaptive quality based on device performance
- Object pooling for game entities
- Optimized particle systems
- Mobile-first responsive design

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!

The fishing game is now fully functional with:
- âœ… Complete motion sensor integration
- âœ… Touch and keyboard fallbacks
- âœ… Full game mechanics (casting, catching, scoring)
- âœ… Professional error handling
- âœ… Mobile-optimized performance
- âœ… Integration with main Fish Log app

**The game is ready for users to enjoy!** ðŸŽ£
