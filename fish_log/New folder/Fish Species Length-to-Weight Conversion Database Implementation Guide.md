# Fish Species Length-to-Weight Conversion Database Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides detailed instructions for implementing the fish species length-to-weight conversion database in your app's autocalculate feature. The database contains comprehensive data for 197 fish species found in South African waters, with accurate algorithms for calculating weight from length measurements.

## Database Structure

The database is provided in multiple formats for flexibility:

1. **Excel Database** (`complete_fish_species_database.xlsx`):
   - Sheet 1: `Length_Weight_Data` - Raw length and weight measurements for all species
   - Sheet 2: `Algorithms` - Calculated algorithms for each species

2. **SQLite Database** (`complete_fish_species_database.db`):
   - Table: `length_weight_data` - Raw length and weight measurements
   - Table: `algorithms` - Calculated algorithms for each species

3. **CSV Data** (`complete_fish_species_data.csv`):
   - Raw length and weight measurements in CSV format for easy import

4. **JSON Algorithms** (`complete_fish_algorithms.json`):
   - Mathematical formulas and coefficients for weight calculation in JSON format

## Length-to-Weight Algorithm

For each fish species, the relationship between length (L) and weight (W) follows the standard formula:

```
W = a Ã— L^b
```

Where:
- W = Weight in kilograms (kg)
- L = Length in centimeters (cm)
- a = Coefficient (species-specific)
- b = Exponent (species-specific)

The database provides the `a` and `b` values for each species, calculated using regression analysis with high R-squared values (most above 0.99), indicating excellent accuracy.

## Measurement Types

Different fish species may use different length measurement types:

1. **Total Length (TL)**: Measured from the tip of the snout to the tip of the tail fin
2. **Fork Length (FL)**: Measured from the tip of the snout to the fork of the tail fin
3. **Standard Length (SL)**: Measured from the tip of the snout to the base of the tail fin
4. **Pre-caudal Length (PCL)**: Measured from the tip of the snout to the pre-caudal pit

The `Measure_Type` field in the database indicates which measurement type is used for each species.

## Implementation in IndexedDB

### Setting Up IndexedDB

```javascript
// Initialize IndexedDB
function initDatabase() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const request = indexedDB.open('FishDatabase', 1);
    
    request.onerror = event => {
      reject('Database error: ' + event.target.errorCode);
    };
    
    request.onupgradeneeded = event => {
      const db = event.target.result;
      
      // Create object store for algorithms
      const algorithmStore = db.createObjectStore('algorithms', { keyPath: 'speciesId' });
      algorithmStore.createIndex('speciesName', 'speciesName', { unique: false });
      algorithmStore.createIndex('edible', 'edible', { unique: false });
      
      // Create object store for raw data (optional)
      const dataStore = db.createObjectStore('lengthWeightData', { keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: true });
      dataStore.createIndex('speciesId', 'speciesId', { unique: false });
    };
    
    request.onsuccess = event => {
      const db = event.target.result;
      resolve(db);
    };
  });
}

// Import algorithms from JSON
async function importAlgorithms(algorithmData) {
  const db = await initDatabase();
  const transaction = db.transaction(['algorithms'], 'readwrite');
  const store = transaction.objectStore('algorithms');
  
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    transaction.oncomplete = () => resolve(true);
    transaction.onerror = event => reject(event.target.error);
    
    // Add each algorithm to the store
    Object.entries(algorithmData).forEach(([speciesId, data]) => {
      store.put({
        speciesId: speciesId,
        speciesName: data.species_name,
        edible: data.edible,
        formula: data.algorithm.formula,
        aParameter: data.algorithm.a,
        bParameter: data.algorithm.b,
        rSquared: data.algorithm.r_squared,
        measureType: data.algorithm.measure_type,
        dataPoints: data.algorithm.data_points
      });
    });
  });
}
```

### Implementing the Autocalculate Feature

```javascript
// Calculate weight from length
async function calculateWeight(speciesId, length) {
  const db = await initDatabase();
  const transaction = db.transaction(['algorithms'], 'readonly');
  const store = transaction.objectStore('algorithms');
  
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const request = store.get(speciesId);
    
    request.onerror = event => {
      reject('Error fetching algorithm: ' + event.target.errorCode);
    };
    
    request.onsuccess = event => {
      const algorithm = event.target.result;
      if (!algorithm) {
        reject('Algorithm not found for species ID: ' + speciesId);
        return;
      }
      
      // Apply the formula: W = a * L^b
      const weight = algorithm.aParameter * Math.pow(length, algorithm.bParameter);
      resolve({
        weight: weight,
        speciesName: algorithm.speciesName,
        measureType: algorithm.measureType,
        accuracy: algorithm.rSquared
      });
    };
  });
}

// Example usage in UI
document.getElementById('calculateButton').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const speciesId = document.getElementById('speciesSelect').value;
  const length = parseFloat(document.getElementById('lengthInput').value);
  
  try {
    const result = await calculateWeight(speciesId, length);
    document.getElementById('weightResult').textContent = 
      `Estimated weight: ${result.weight.toFixed(2)} kg`;
    document.getElementById('accuracyInfo').textContent = 
      `Calculation accuracy: ${(result.accuracy * 100).toFixed(1)}%`;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    document.getElementById('weightResult').textContent = 'Error calculating weight';
  }
});
```

## React Native Implementation

For React Native applications, you can use the `react-native-sqlite-storage` package:

```javascript
import SQLite from 'react-native-sqlite-storage';

// Initialize database
const db = SQLite.openDatabase(
  {name: 'fish_species_database.db', location: 'default'},
  () => console.log('Database opened successfully'),
  error => console.error('Error opening database', error)
);

// Calculate weight function
const calculateWeight = (speciesId, length) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    db.transaction(tx => {
      tx.executeSql(
        'SELECT * FROM algorithms WHERE Species_ID = ?',
        [speciesId],
        (_, results) => {
          if (results.rows.length > 0) {
            const algorithm = results.rows.item(0);
            const weight = algorithm.a_parameter * Math.pow(length, algorithm.b_parameter);
            resolve({
              weight,
              speciesName: algorithm.Species_Name,
              measureType: algorithm.Measure_Type,
              accuracy: algorithm.R_squared
            });
          } else {
            reject('Species not found');
          }
        },
        (_, error) => reject(error)
      );
    });
  });
};
```

## Data Validation and Error Handling

When implementing the autocalculate feature, consider these validation steps:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Ensure length values are positive numbers
   - Verify length is within reasonable range for the selected species
   - Provide clear error messages for invalid inputs

2. **Result Validation**:
   - Check if calculated weight is within reasonable range
   - Display confidence level based on R-squared value
   - Provide warnings for extrapolations beyond the data range

```javascript
function validateLengthInput(length, speciesData) {
  if (length <= 0) {
    return { valid: false, message: 'Length must be positive' };
  }
  
  // Check if length is within data range
  const minLength = speciesData.minLength || 0;
  const maxLength = speciesData.maxLength || Infinity;
  
  if (length < minLength) {
    return { 
      valid: false, 
      message: `Length is below minimum recorded value (${minLength} cm)` 
    };
  }
  
  if (length > maxLength) {
    return { 
      valid: true, 
      warning: `Length exceeds maximum recorded value (${maxLength} cm), estimate may be less accurate` 
    };
  }
  
  return { valid: true };
}
```

## Performance Optimization

For optimal performance in your app:

1. **Preload Common Species**:
   - Load algorithms for commonly used species at app startup
   - Cache results for frequently accessed species

2. **Batch Processing**:
   - For bulk calculations, use transaction batching
   - Consider using Web Workers for intensive calculations

3. **Offline Support**:
   - Store the complete algorithm database locally
   - Implement sync mechanisms for database updates

## Species Coverage

The database includes 197 fish species found in South African waters, including:

- **Shy Shark**: Data derived from Brown Shyshark parameters (a=0.00355, b=3.08) as a proxy for the general Shy Shark category.

These additions further enhance the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the database for your autocalculate feature.



## Self-Improving Algorithm for New Species

To allow for continuous improvement and expansion of the database with species not yet included, a self-improving algorithm has been implemented. This feature enables the app to learn and refine length-to-weight relationships for new or existing species based on user-provided data.

### How it Works

The self-improving algorithm utilizes the power law formula (`W = a Ã— L^b`) and `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` for non-linear regression. When new length and weight data points are provided for a specific species, the algorithm performs the following steps:

1.  **Data Collection**: New length and weight measurements for a given species are added to a dedicated dataset for that species.
2.  **Parameter Recalculation**: Once at least two data points are available for a species, the `a` and `b` coefficients of the length-to-weight formula are recalculated using the accumulated data. The `r_squared` value is also updated to reflect the accuracy of the newly fitted curve.
3.  **Algorithm Update**: The updated `a`, `b`, and `r_squared` values are stored, replacing any previous algorithm for that species. This ensures that the most accurate available algorithm is always used.

This iterative process allows the algorithm to become more precise as more data points are collected, effectively 'self-improving' over time.

### Integrating the Self-Improving Feature

To integrate this feature into your app, you will need a mechanism for users to input new length and weight data for a species. This data can then be used to update the algorithm. Below is a conceptual Python function that demonstrates how to use the `update_species_algorithm` function (from `self_improving_algorithm.py`) within your application's backend or a data processing module.

```python
# Example of how to use the self-improving algorithm in your application
from self_improving_algorithm import update_species_algorithm

def handle_user_input_data(species_name, length_cm, weight_kg):
    algorithms_file = "/home/ubuntu/fish_data_merged/final_output/complete_fish_algorithms.json"
    data_points_file = "/home/ubuntu/self_improving_data_points.json" # This file stores raw data points for self-improvement

    result = update_species_algorithm(species_name, length_cm, weight_kg, algorithms_file, data_points_file)

    if result["status"] == "success":
        print(f"Algorithm for {species_name} updated successfully. New a: {result["a"]:.6f}, b: {result["b"]:.6f}, R-squared: {result["r_squared"]:.4f} (Data points: {result["data_points_count"]})")
    elif result["status"] == "pending":
        print(f"Algorithm calculation pending for {species_name}. Need more data points. (Current: {result["data_points_count"]})")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to update algorithm for {species_name}: {result["message"]}")

# Example usage:
# When a user inputs data for a new species or an existing one:
# handle_user_input_data("New Angler Fish", 25, 0.3)
# handle_user_input_data("New Angler Fish", 30, 0.5)
# handle_user_input_data("Albacore (M&F)", 150, 170) # Refine existing Albacore algorithm
```

### Considerations for Implementation

-   **Data Storage**: The `self_improving_data_points.json` file is used to store the raw length-weight data points provided by users. This file should be managed securely and backed up regularly.
-   **User Interface**: Design a clear and intuitive interface for users to submit new length and weight measurements. Provide feedback on whether the data was successfully processed and if an algorithm was updated.
-   **Data Validation**: Implement client-side and server-side validation for user-inputted data to ensure accuracy and prevent erroneous calculations. For example, check for positive values, realistic ranges, and consistent units.
-   **Algorithm Refresh**: Decide on a strategy for when to recalculate algorithms (e.g., after every new data point, after a certain number of new data points, or on a scheduled basis).
-   **Initial Data**: For entirely new species, the algorithm will require at least two data points to begin calculating `a` and `b` parameters. Consider providing a default or estimated algorithm until sufficient user data is collected.

This self-improving mechanism provides a powerful way to keep your app's autocalculate feature current and accurate, even for species that may not have extensive pre-existing data.
