## Notes
- Some freshwater species like Common Carp and Tilapia may not be listed on this primarily marine-focused website
- For each species, we'll extract length-to-weight data and calculate algorithms for the app's autocalculate feature
- Priority will be given to the most commonly caught species and those found in rivers near the coast
